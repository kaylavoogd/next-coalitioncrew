      <h4>Meet the Founders:</h4>
      <p> Peter & Kayla Voogd </p>
      <p>
        They are the founders of the Forbes featured Game Changers Academy
        (GameChangersMovement.com), which was created in 2013. They both have a
        deep passion for animals and for helping people, which is why the
        Coalition Crew is focused on both.
      </p>
      <p>
        They want to pave a new way in the NFT space by giving back to the
        world, and by bringing utility that helps people become the best
        versions of themselves while also donating a portion of each sale to
        World Wildlife Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>They have two amazing kids, Santana and Siena.</p>
